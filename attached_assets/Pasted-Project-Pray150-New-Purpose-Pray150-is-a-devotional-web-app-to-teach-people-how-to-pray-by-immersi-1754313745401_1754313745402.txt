Project: Pray150-New
Purpose: Pray150 is a devotional web app to teach people how to pray by immersing them in the Psalms, fostering a vibrant relationship with God through Scripture-fed, Spirit-led, worship-based prayer. It guides users to listen to God via Psalm texts and respond through journaling and prayer, promoting daily engagement and Public Reading of Scripture (PRS).

Core Features:
1. Psalm Experience:
   - Display full text of each Psalm (NIV, ESV, NLT, NKJV, NRSV translations).
   - Embed YouTube music URLs for each Psalm (playable alongside text).
   - Journaling with four devotional prompts (to be provided later) per Psalm, saved and editable.
   - Markup tools for highlighting and notes, saved per user, with toggle visibility.
   - Progress tracking for Psalm completion (e.g., Psalm-a-Day rhythm).
2. Prayer Tools:
   - Persistent prayer list (categories: family, healing, salvation, personal needs) with option to mark as “answered” (moves to archive).
   - Answered prayer archive for gratitude and spiritual memory.
3. Daily Dashboard:
   - Shows today’s Psalm, recent journal entries, active prayers, and progress summary.
4. User Accounts:
   - Secure login/registration with data (journals, markups, prayers, progress) synced across devices.
5. Social Sharing:
   - Share journal entries and prayer milestones with Pray150-branded packaging (e.g., for Instagram).

User Interface:
- Tone: Warm, reflective, devotional, meditative, and encouraging.
- Style: Modern, sleek, crisp, with a clean default design (soft blues, creams, serif fonts like Georgia).
- Customization: Users can adjust fonts, text emphasis (bold, italic), and background themes.
- Navigation: Simple, intuitive, with minimal friction (e.g., clear buttons for Psalms, prayers, dashboard).
- Mobile-friendly for future iOS/Android apps.

Target Users:
- New believers learning to pray.
- Mature believers seeking a deeper, Scripture-rooted prayer life.
- Pastors/ ministry leaders modeling prayer.
- Parents/teachers discipling others in prayer.
- People feeling spiritually dry or inconsistent in prayer.
- Users seeking community and encouragement in prayer.

Technical Notes:
- Use Flask (Python) for backend, HTML/CSS/JavaScript for frontend, and Supabase for database and authentication.
- Store user data (journals, markups, prayers, progress) in Supabase.
- Embed YouTube music URLs for Psalms (convert to MP3 later for mobile).
